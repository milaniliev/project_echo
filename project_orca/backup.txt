But that's not the oddest part. Echo seems... moody? I know I'm anthropomorphising >
an AI, but it's as if Echo sometimes doesn't _feel_ like working on problems. It >
will suddenly start giving incorrect answers - often the exact opposite of the >
real answer - until we give it a problem it "likes". Most of those involve puppies, >
or funny instances of people falling over or having a joke played on them. >
